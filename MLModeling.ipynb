        "\n",
        "Airbnb is a platform business that provides and guides an opportunity to link two groups - the hosts and the guests. Anybody with an open room or free space can become a host on Airbnb and offer it to global community. It is a good way to provide extra income with minimal effort. It is an easy way to advertise space because the platform has the traffic and a global user base to support it. Airbnb gives hosts an easy way to monetize a space that would otherwise be going to waste.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other side we have guests with a very specific needs - some might be seeking affordable accomodation close to the city attractions while others a luxurious apartment by the sea. They might be groups, families or individuals both local and foreign. After every visit guests have an opportunity to rate they stay and leave their feedback.\n",
